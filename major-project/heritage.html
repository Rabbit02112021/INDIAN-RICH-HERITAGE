            <p style="font-family:verdana">India Gate is one of many British monuments built by order of the Imperial
                War Graves Commission (later renamed Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The architect was Sir Edwin
                Lutyens, an Englishman who designed numerous other war memorials and was also the principal planner of
                New Delhi. The cornerstone was laid in 1921 by the duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria.
                Construction of the All-India War Memorial, as it was originally known, continued until 1931, the year
                of the formal dedication of New Delhi as the capital of India. Lutyens declined to incorporate pointed
                arches or other Asian motifs in his design but strove instead for classical simplicity. The result is
                often described as similar in appearance to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. On the rooftop above the
                archway is a broad shallow domed bowl that was intended to be filled with flaming oil on ceremonial
                occasions. No fires have been set on the rooftop in recent years, but four eternal flames are now
                sheltered at the base of the structure. The flames demarcate the Amar Jawan Jyoti, a small monument that
                has served as India’s tomb of the unknown soldier since 1971.</p>

                of the Yamuna River, built in red sandstone, covering a length of 2.5 kilometres . It is
                surrounded by a moat which encloses several palaces, towers, and mosques. They were built
                from the 16th century onward until the early 18th century. This corresponds to Emperor
                Akbar's reign in the 16th century to that of Aurangzeb in the early part of the 18th
                century, including the contributions made during the reign of Jahangir and Shahjahan of the
                Moghul Rule in India. </p>

                was built by Emperor Shahjahan in memory of his third wife Begum Mumtaz Mahal who had died
                in 1631. It is a large edifice made in white marble in typical Mughal architecture, a style
                that combines elements from Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles. This much
                acclaimed masterpiece was built over a 16-year period between 1631 and 1648 under the Chief
                Architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri supported by several thousand artisans under the guidance of
                an Imperial Committee. It was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983, under
                Category i, as a cultural property/monument. It is set amidst the vast Mughal Gardens, which
                cover 17 hectares (42 acres) of land on the right bank of the Yamuna River. ]</p>

            <p style="font-family:verdana">The Lotus Temple was consecrated and opened to the public in December 1986.
                It was designed by Iranian architect Fariborz Sahba, who won acclaim for the project even before the
                temple was completed. It subsequently received several awards. The Lotus Temple derives its name from
                its design. Like every other Bahāʾī mashriq, it is characterized by a nine-sided construction, in
                keeping with the Bahāʾī belief in the mystical properties of the number nine. Set on an elevated plinth
                in a 26-acre (10.5-hectare) expanse of landscaped gardens and surrounded by nine pools bordered by red
                sandstone walkways, the white marble edifice rises to a height of more than 130 feet (40 metres). The
                temple complex comprises 27 independent marble “petals,” which are clustered into groups of three to
                form nine sides (through which open nine entrances into a central space) and into groups of nine to form
                three concentric rings.</p>

            <p style="font-family:verdana">The Somnath temple located in Prabhas Patan near Veraval in Saurashtra on the
                western coast of Gujarat, is believed to be the first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. It
                is an important pilgrimage and tourist spot of Gujarat.Reconstructed several times in the past after
                repeated destruction by several Muslim invaders and Portuguese the present temple was reconstructed in
                Chaulukya style of Hindu temple architecture and completed in May 1951. The reconstruction was completed
                by Vallabhbhai Patel. The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of
                being a Triveni sangam (the confluence of three rivers — Kapila, Hiran and Sarasvati. SomaMoon god, is
                believed to have lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to
                regain it. The result is the waxing and waning of the moon, no doubt an allusion to the waxing and
                waning of the tides at this sea shore location. The name of the town Prabhas, meaning lustre, as well as
                the alternative names Someshvar and Somnath (“The lord of the moon” or “the moon god”) arise from this
                tradition.</p>

                who symbolically had it placed on a lower level so that even the humblest had to step down to enter it.
                He also included entrances on all four sides, signifying that it was open to worshippers of all castes
                and creeds. The foundation stone was laid by Mian Mīr, a Muslim divine of Lahore (now in Pakistan). The
                temple was destroyed several times by Afghan invaders and was finally rebuilt in marble and copper
                overlaid with gold foil during the reign (1801–39) of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The structure thus became
                known as the Golden Temple.</p>

        <div class="heritage__right">
            <p style="font-family:verdana">Built in the early 13th century a few kilometres south of Delhi, the red
                sandstone tower of Qutb Minar is 72.5 m high, tapering from 2.75 m in diameter at its peak to 14.32 m at
                its base, and alternating angular and rounded flutings. The surrounding archaeological area contains
                funerary buildings, notably the magnificent Alai-Darwaza Gate, the masterpiece of Indo-Muslim art (built
                in 1311), and two mosques, including the Quwwatu'l-Islam, the oldest in northern India, built of
                materials reused from some 20 Brahman temples. The origins of Qutab Minar are shrouded in controversy.
                Some believe it was erected as a tower of victory to signify the beginning of the Muslim rule in India.
                Others say it served as a minaret to the muezzins to call the faithful to prayer. No one can, however,
                dispute that the tower is not only one of the finest monuments in India, but also in the world.
                Qutab-ud-din Aibak, the first Muslim ruler of Delhi, commenced the construction of the Qutab Minar in
                1200 AD, but could only finish the basement. His successor, Iltutmush, added three more storeys, and in
                1368, Firoz Shah Tughlak constructed the fifth and the last storey. The development of architectural
                styles from Aibak to Tughlak is quite evident in the minar. The relief work and even the materials used
                for construction differ. The 238 feet Qutab Minar is 47 feet at the base and tapers to nine feet at the
                apex. The tower is ornamented by bands of inscriptions and by four projecting balconies supported by
                elaborately decorated brackets. Even though in ruins, the Quwwat Ui Islam (Light of Islam) Mosque in the
                Qutab complex is one of the most magnificent structures in the world. Qutab-ud-din Aibak started its
                construction in 1193 and the mosque was completed in 1197. Iltutmush in 1230 and Alla-ud-din Khilji in
                1315 made additions to the building. The main mosque comprises of an inner and outer courtyard,decorated
                with shafts and surrounded by piller. Most of these shafts are from the 27 Hindu temples, which were
                plundered to construct the mosque. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Muslim mosque has typical
                Hindu ornamentation. Close to the mosque is one of Delhi's most curious antiques, the Iron Pillar.</p>
