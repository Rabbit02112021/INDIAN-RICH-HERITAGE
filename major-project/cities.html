                        <p style="font-family:verdana">Jaipur is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of
                            Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city had a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most
                            populous city in the country. Jaipur is also known as the Pink City, due to the dominant
                            color scheme of its buildings. It is located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital
                            New Delhi..
                            Jaipur was founded in 1727 by the Rajput ruler Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amer, after whom
                            the city is named. It was one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by
                            Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. During the British Colonial period, the city served as the capital
                            of Jaipur State. After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made capital of the newly-formed
                            state of Rajasthan.

                        <p style="font-family:verdana">Sikandar Lodi was the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate to move
                            his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, and so he is regarded as being the founder of Agra.
                            Sikandar Lodi's son, Ibrahim Lodi, was defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526 by Babur,
                            which marked the beginning of Mughal Empire.[10]In a brief interruption in Mughal rule
                            between 1540 and 1556, Sher Shah Suri, established the short lived Sur Empire. Agra was the
                            capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648, under the Mughal Emperors Akbar, Jahangir
                            and Shah Jahan, after which Shah Jahan shifted the capital to Delhi.

                            Agra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably
                            the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage
                            Sites.[8] Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and
                            Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with
                            Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra is in the Braj cultural region.</p>

                            subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term "Kashmir" denoted only the Kashmir Valley
                            between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. Today, the term encompasses a larger
                            area that includes the Indian-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

                            In the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of
                            Hinduism and later of Buddhism; later still, in the ninth century, Kashmir Shaivism arose.
                            In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the
                            Salatin-i-Kashmir or Shah Mir dynasty.Kashmir was part of the Mughal Empire from 1586 to
                            1751 and thereafter, until 1820, of the Afghan Durrani Empire That year, the Sikhs, under
                            Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War,
                            and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar,
